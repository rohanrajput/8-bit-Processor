## Key Tasks

1. **Simulation:**
   - Simulated the Verilog code to verify the processor's functionality.

2. **Synthesis & Hardware Testing:**
   - Used Xilinx Vivado to synthesize the Verilog code.
   - Generated a bitstream for the Xilinx FPGA board.
   - Downloaded the bitstream to the FPGA for hardware testing.

## Technologies Used
