2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell aluOp_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) aluOp_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell aluSrc_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) aluSrc_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell aluSrc_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) aluSrc_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell memRead_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) memRead_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell memRead_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) memRead_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell memWrite_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) memWrite_reg/CLR, regWrite_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch aluOp_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin aluOp_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch aluSrc_reg/L7 (in aluSrc_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin aluSrc_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch memRead_reg/L7 (in memRead_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin memRead_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch memWrite_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin memWrite_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch regWrite_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin regWrite_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 5 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
